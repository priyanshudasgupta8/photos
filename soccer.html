    <p>This is the list of the best soccer players of all time (according to me):</p>
    <ol>
      <li id="m">Messi</li>
      <p>Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini was born 24 June 1987. He is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward and captains both Spanish club Barcelona and the Argentina national team. Often considered the best player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record six Ballon d'Or awards and a record six European Golden Shoes. He has spent his entire professional career with Barcelona where he has won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, four UEFA Champions League titles and six Copas del Rey. A prolific goalscorer and a creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (433), a La Liga and European league season (50), most hat-tricks in La Liga (35) and the UEFA Champions League (8), and most assists in La Liga (175) and the Copa América (13).

      <li id="ma">Maradona</li>
      <p>Diego Armando Maradona was born 30 October 1960 and is an Argentine football manager and retired professional footballer. He is currently the coach of Argentine Primera División club Gimnasia de La Plata. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest football players of all time. He was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the 20th Century award. Maradona's vision, passing, ball control and dribbling skills were combined with his small stature (5 ft 5 in), which would allow him to often dribble past multiple opposing players on a run. His presence and leadership on the field had a great effect on his team's general performance, while he would often be singled out by the opposition. A precocious talent, Maradona was given the nickname "The Golden Boy", a name that stuck with him throughout his career. He also won the 1986 World Cup for Argentina<br><br>For more information about Maradona, <span class="blinking">click</span> <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona" target="_blank">here</a></p>

      <p>Edson Arantes do Nascimento was born 23 October 1940 and is also known as Pelé. He is a Brazilian retired professional footballer who played as a forward. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time. In 1999, he was voted World Player of the Century by the International Federation of Football History and Statistics (IFFHS), and was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the Century award. That same year, Pelé was elected Athlete of the Century by the International Olympic Committee. According to the IFFHS, Pelé is the most successful domestic league goal-scorer in football history scoring 650 goals in 694 League matches, and in total 1281 goals in 1363 games, which included unofficial friendlies and is a Guinness World Record. During his playing days, Pelé was for a period the best-paid athlete in the world. He also holds the record for winning the most number of World Cups: 3<br><br>For more information about Pelé, <span class="blinking">click</span> <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pele" target="_blank">here</a></p>

    <p>Not to brag or show off, I think I am a good soccer player as well.</p>
    <p>Also here are the reasons why soccer is better than any other sport:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is a team sport, so you can socialize with others</li>
      <li>It teaches you to have control over your body</li>
    </ul>

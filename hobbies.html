    <p>This is the list of the best soccer players of all time (according to me):</p>
    <ol>
      <li id="meh">Messi</li>

      <li>Maradona</li>
      <p><img src="maradona.jpg" alt="Maradona" width="250" align="left">Diego Armando Maradona was born 30 October 1960 and is an Argentine football manager and retired professional footballer. He is currently the coach of Argentine Primera División club Gimnasia de La Plata. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest football players of all time. He was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the 20th Century award. Maradona's vision, passing, ball control and dribbling skills were combined with his small stature (5 ft 5 in), which would allow him to often dribble past multiple opposing players on a run. His presence and leadership on the field had a great effect on his team's general performance, while he would often be singled out by the opposition. A precocious talent, Maradona was given the nickname "The Golden Boy", a name that stuck with him throughout his career. He also won the 1986 World Cup for Argentina<br><br>For more information about Maradona, <span class="blinking">click</span> <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona" target="_blank">here</a></p>
